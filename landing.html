    It’s easy to have FAITH everything is going to work out, when everything IS working out.<br>
    It’s much harder to have faith when you are facing challenges in your life. But that is exactly when you need to apply your faith.<br>

    Because faith is believing in the unseen. Faith is taking the first step. Faith is jumping in the deep end and KNOWING everything will be OK.<br>

    It’s easy to be positive when everything is working out... It’s much harder, much much harder when nothing is working out... But that’s when we need it the most.<br>

    EVERYTHING WORTH THE PRIZE!<br>
    IS WORTH THE FIGHT!<br>

    Everything worth the prize will require a real fight to achieve that prize.<br>

    If you want the prize you can’t quit at half time. You can’t quit mid season. You must play the whole game. Pre season, through the cold, through darkness, through the challenges, the opponents.<br>

    You will be knocked down… but you MIST GET UP. KEEP FIGHTING. DIG DEEP and discover your true STRENGTH.<br>

    Then you will win the real prize:<br>
    CHARACTER.<br>
    EXPANSION.<br>
    YOU rising to the next level<br>

    IF I SURVIVE THE STORM, I CAN OUTDO THE NORM.<br>
    TO BREAKTHROUGH THE NORM, I MUST FIRST SURIVE THE STORMS.<br>
    TO HAVE MORE THAN MOST – I MUST DO MORE THAN MOST. BELIEVE MORE THAN MOST. LEARN MORE THAN MOST. SACRIFICE MORE THAN MOST. BELIEVE MORE THAN MOST.
